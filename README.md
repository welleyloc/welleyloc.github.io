### Java apps (JavaFX)

1. **Art Supply Inventory**, [Download application(jar)](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/tree/master/Art%20supply%20inventory/JavaFXApp) / [Java code](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Art%20supply%20inventory/ArtSupplyInventory.java), a simple GUI I made to keep track of my paint/pencil inventory because I buy duplicate colors sometimes. Inventory is stored in CSVs and are searchable via the GUI. Currently for desktop, but ideally should be for the phone. To use the app, keep the jar file and csvs in the same folder.

### Homework

1. **To-do list (DOM-1)**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/DOM-1-080819/index.html), goal was to make an interactive to-do list using material from JQuery to DOM lectures. Additional functionalities have been added beyond the original lab assignment (enter keycode, local storage).

2. **CSS-1**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/CSS-1-080119/index.html), assignment was to replicate a pie chart using only HTML/CSS and the images (search glass and cart) provided.

3. **Bootstrap-1**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/Bootstrap-1-081319/index.html), assignment was to introduce different Bootstrap (local) components onto a webpage.  

4. **Typescript-ng**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/Typescript-ng-081419/index.html), assignment involved the basics of typescript and compiling it to fill an HTML page with employee data.

5. **JS-Libraries**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/JS-Libraries/), a demonstration of various libraries in the land of Javascript (Lodash, Moment, Math, Datatables, Chart (bar/line), React, and Vue).

6. **Angular**, [Demo](https://welleyloc.github.io/angular-intro/), an introduction to the framework with five different components covering observables, forms, animations, and libraries (Material/PrimeNG libraries not included here due to deprecated imports preventing project build with Angular 8.3).
